# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Mohammed


## Dataset

Ford GoBike System Data contain informations about GoBike system which store the information for each bike used in trips like the distance and the start and end time of the trip also the name of stations destination. 
There are 94802 records in the dataset with 14 features ( duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type and bike_share_for_all_trip)


## Summary of Findings

The normal distribution for duration is betweet 300 and 1000. There is unusual duartion values when goes above the 10 or 12 thousand. The Subscribers represents 87 percent of the users in the GoBike ford system data. As it looks from the graph the subscribers are 8 times of the customers that's huge number. Only subscribers who use Bike Share which I guess it means only the subscribers could benefit from this offer of subscribition. All of the Customers not using Bike Share.

Most trips taken with durations equal to :
#1 84193
#2 84609
#3 85079
#4 85422
#5 85546

the most trip taken are above the 80 thousand duration which I want them because they define one of my goals of this analysis which is getting the most trips taken in the GoBike ford system. 
most of trips duration are between 300 to 1 thousand as previous result from the univariate visualization but as it shows maybe reach to 10 thousand approximately as nearly number for the most trips duration based on distance.

it comes more clear for me with the non positional encodings that the Customers have higher value of distance and duration even when they less number of users than the Subscribers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The Customers have higher value of distance and duration even when they less number of users than the Subscribers. The subscribers represent 87% of the users in GoBike System data but it doesn't have the higher duration for trips as whole for January month at 2018. The most 3 trips taken was by Customers not from Subscribers.
